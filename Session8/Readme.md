Session8 - Assignment

Assignment 1 (100 points):
Look at the code we covered today. Change the languages from german<>english to french<>german (if you are not comfortable in using raw data in github for french, then change g<>e to english<> german translation)
Change the model such that it has 3 layers instead of 2
Train the model on Colab, upload to Github and share the link

Assignment 2 (900 points):
Look at this sample file: sample.py Preview the documentYou are to write such examples, where you describe the code to be written (starts with #), and the code it should generate. The file shows 3 examples of what text should generate what code. 
write 100 such examples. These are the requirements:
if you want the code to print something, then mention "print" in the text
read the sample.py clearly to see the examples and learn from it. If you want the code to write a program, you are NOT asking to write a function. If you want a function, please mention it. 
run the code in the terminal/notebook and make sure it runs!
you cannot write more than 5 simple functions like add 2/3/4/5 numbers or divide, etc. Try and think of something tough, for example, add a list or tuple together. 
stick to python only (no 3rd party library like numpy, etc)
