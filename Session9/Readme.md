Build one Seq2Seq model and one Seq2Seq model with attention on four datasets for chatbot training. [Link to more datasets] (https://kili-technology.com/blog/chatbot-training-datasets/)
1. [The Stanford Question Answering Dataset(SQuAD)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) is a set of reading comprehension data consisting of questions asked by social workers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to each question is a segment of text, or span, of the corresponding reading passage. With more than 100,000 question-answer pairs on more than 500 articles, SQuAD is significantly larger than previous reading comprehension datasets. SQuAD2.0 combines the 100,000 questions from SQuAD1.1 with more than 50,000 new unanswered questions written in a contradictory manner by crowd workers to look like answered questions.
2. [Hotpot Dataset](https://hotpotqa.github.io/) is a set of question response data that includes natural multi-skip questions, with a strong emphasis on supporting facts to allow for more explicit question answering systems. The data set consists of 113,000 Wikipedia-based QA pairs
3. [Cornell Movie Dialog Dataset](http://www.mpi-sws.org/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) This corpus contains an extensive collection of metadata-rich fictional conversations extracted from raw movie scripts: 220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 movie character pairs involving 9,035 characters from 617 movies.
4. [Twitter Customer Support Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter) This Kaggle dataset includes more than 3 million tweets and responses from leading brands on Twitter.
